-= Refactoring =-
    ☐  Use a state system. Game should only be able to be saved in certain states.
        ☐  Combat State
            ☐  Unsaveable
        ☐  City/Buildings State
            ☐  Saveable ? [Buildings have specific screens that may be dynamic. They probably shouldn`t be savable.]
        ☐  TalkBox State
            ☐  Saveable
        ☐  Map State
            ☐  Saveable

    ☐  Passage Tags can decide CSS, a la 
        ☐  #passages[data-tags~=".Combat"]
        ☐  #passages[data-tags~=".Dungeon"]
        ☐  #passages[data-tags~=".Overworld"]
        ☐  #passages[data-tags~=".Town"]

    ☐  Passage Tags should be refactored:
        ☐  .tag => Common tags for CSS [classes] e.g. .overworld, .helper, .combat
        ☐  #tag => Unique tags for CSS [IDs] e.g. #CombatOverlord
        ☑  tag => Functional/Compiler tags e.g. nostats 


-= Quests =-
(For setting up quests, see Guild Hall -> Quest Screen)
    ☐  Random Map
        ☑  Grid-Based Movement System with Click/Tap to Move.
            ☑  Party Icon Moveable on Map
            ☑  Dialog opens when party icon reaches encounter.
        ☐  Encounters on Map
        ☐  Maps Rotatable with Aligned Icons (for Portrait/Landscape mode)

    ☐  VN Style TalkBox
    ("Dialog" is a term already used by SugarCube.)
        ☐  TalkBox words.
        ☐  TalkBox portrait?
