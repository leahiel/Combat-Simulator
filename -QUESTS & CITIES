-= Structure of Quest =-
A Quest is a collection of information that gives meaning to Maps, determining which interactables are visible at which time. 
They should load all required data at the start of them. Expected quest time is 15 to 30 minutes.
They also collect maps:
    Maps should be procedurally generated with a collection of Interactables:
        Interactables can be combat, talkboxes, or cities. [Later, also places that give items.]
