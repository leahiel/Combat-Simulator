Arena Groundhogs Day


There will be a terrorist attack on Section 1-U an hour before dusk in the crowd stadium. Section 1-U is an overhang, and when the explosion happens, not only will be the upper section be demolished, killing all the people who normally watch from there, so will people in the lower section 1-L from the debris falling down on them.

It is your job as an arena participant to ensure that all the people in Section 1-U and 1-L leave the stadium before the they die. How you do it is up to you.

Story Randomization Stuff:
    Either fight monsters, or named opponents.



(Note, this story is based off a real life event that occurred in Baltimore on December 19th, 1976, wherein a plane crashed into the stands (Section 1) 6 minutes after the [American] football game ended, but no one was hurt because the Baltimore Colts were so absolutely blown out by the Steelers that the fans started leaving the game early. If you've got 42 minutes, check out this excellent documentary here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alcVZZuj_WE>

More specifically, the first youtube comment by ZakR says, "Imagine a final destination/ground hog day type movie where the Steelers head coach or quarterback has to keep re-living the game over and over until they beat the Baltimore so badly that no one gets hurt." I don't care for sports, so I simply transposed the idea into a fantasy setting.)


The Pit
Wake up very early cause there are no fights at night. 
You're in dirt. 
Talk about m v. f treatment, and how lucky there are no men/how luck there are a few women.
Wash up. Choose whether to shave (male beard or female nether regions).

Then head to roll call.
With 21 people, you would fight 5 people. If you win all of them quick enough, there won't be anyone to fight, and thus the crowd would disperse. Many people would be seeded and not fight at all the first round.

Anime notable for setting/plot that I haven't internalized:

Princess Principal				(Steampunk setting which I'm unfamiliar with.)
