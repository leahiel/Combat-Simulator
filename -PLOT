You're living in the Ever-After. You use a time-machine to go to the Ever-Before.  The Ever-Ever is the world that the users actually live in.

In order to understand what is too advanced in this world, you're limited. So you can't use your version of Magic without understanding the world's version of magic. Same with equipment. But once you understand one version, you can send multiples over to equip yourself and your party.
