At 73 downloads a day:

* If my game were a free to play product with microtransactions, I could expect 33USD a day at minimum from this quantity of downloads. It doesn't sound like much, but that's 12k USD in a year.
* If my game were a book, priced at 80 words per cent, I could expect 6.80USD per download. I'd have less downloads, but at 6% of my downloads, that'd be 30USD a day (11k USD/yr).  6% is admittedly generous, though.
* Research SteamSpy to determine appropriate pricing based on the Steam market.

So I put in a lot of thought, and I think I'm going to add something like a "Monthly Costs Minus Labor Coverage" bar to my games, showing how underfunded they are, so it'd be like:

```
// Low
[|||||||       ] 23/40USD
// Full
[||||||||||||||] 100%!
```
But now I'm worried if showing a 100% costs covered bar would be wise. Might make people think that there is no reason to support.
Perhaps I make the goal change as donations go in, but then that seems fraudulent.  Alternatively, I can make it grow at the same rate I work in hours, which wouldn't be fraudulent as I'd just be adding my labor cost.


The Alchemist never got on the SERPs.
The Field Biologist fell off the SERPs after about eleven days.
The Lucky Elixir never got on the SERPs.

0.08% Views -> 1USD (Every ~2,500 views is 1USD.)      (50,000 USD => 125,000,000 views)

Eevery 2,500 views, I make 1 USD. 
Thus, I would need 125,000,000 views a year to make 50,000USD.
