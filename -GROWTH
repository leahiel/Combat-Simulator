-= Stats and Growth =-
    Each level should exponentially increase calculated stats by 2 to 4%. Then, the game can be about increasing base stats, and everything can be balanced. Not sure how to handle Init, though.
    Base stats would be split into 3 types:
        Character: These are the stats you start with, plus bonii for reaching profiency levels and bestiary levels.
        Items: The items you equipped. This would make balancing them easier too, as you can use the same weapon for all levels. On stat screens, this should include mods too.
    These would be added up and then multiplied by the exponential modifier.
    Of note, the higher the bestiary level of a mob, the less experience it gives.
    ...The experience a monster gives is also increased by levels.
