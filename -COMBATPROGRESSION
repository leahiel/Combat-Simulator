TODO:
    Add in buffs/debuffs.
    Really, I want some way for attacks to process their own special code. Perhaps AttackCalculations will have a section that is like:
        attack.custom(targets)
    Where the attack.custom() is something like:
        attack.custom = (targets) => {for (target in targets) {target.health += 1}}
    This will allow custom code to run for buffs and debuffs.
    
     

☐  = Planned for Implementation
☑  = Currently Implemented
→  = Planned for Implementation next cycle.

    ☑  Combat primitive functional.
    ☑  1v1 only.
    ☐  Attacks based on weapon.
    ☐  Attack Statistics Visible to User
    ☐  Monster Statistics Visible to User

    These Affixes are Complete and Used on Combatants and Attacks:
    ☑    Damage (of each type)
    ☑    Init [start, base, and recovery]
    ☑    Health [Combatant Only]
    ☑    Blocking
    ☑    Grazes
    ☑    Critical Hit (Chance [Base/Increased/More], Strike [Base/Increased/More])
    ☑    Direct Hit (Chance [Base/Increased/More], Strike [Base/Increased/More])
    ☑     Absorb (Percent, PercentMax, Flat)
    ☑     Resistant (base, Max)
    ☑     Reduct (base)

    These Affixes are Missing on Combatants/Attacks:
    →    Stunning
    ☐   Weapon Expertise Modifier
    →    Targets Able to Hit (Attacks)
    →    Targets to Hit (Attacker)
    →    1 v [1-5]
    ☐   [1-4] v [1-5]
    
    These Features Missing in Combat:
        Weapon Damage Modifier on Attacks. (There are no weapons yet!)

    ☐ No Real Guide/Help system. Good luck!
    ☐ No Equipment. (Subsequently, No Item Affixes.)
    ☐ No Experience, No Leveling, No growth.
    ☐ No Monster Affixes.
    ☐ No Realistic/Intended Difficulty Setting Change
    → No Buffs/Debuffs (These last their length in units of init.)
