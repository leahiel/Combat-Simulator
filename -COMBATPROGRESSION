TODO for indev release: 
☐  Add content.
    ☑ Attacks
    ☐ Equippables
        ☐  14 weapons, 2 for each weapon type.
        ☐  8 Accessories
        ☐  8 Armors
    ☐  10 mods for each slot.
        ☐  Also, tags on mods work. Mods and Equipment must share at least one tag to be compatible.
        Weapon Ideas:
            Init Recovery Modifier
            Damage (increased/more/flat)
            CC
            CH
            DC
        Armor Ideas:
            Reduct
            Resistance
            Init Start
        Accessory Ideas:
            Init Decrement Modifier
            pretty much the same as the above two?
☐  Add Preset character options to start/inbetween.
    ☑  Switching functional.
    ☐  Tank
    ☐  AoE Bruiser
    ☐  Buffer
    ☐  Chaos User
☐  B A L A N C E

When Balancing:
    Monsters` innate stats have to make up for their lack of equipment.
    Mods are what makes humans stronger than monsters, not equipment.
    That means that all equipment should be relatively equal in strength, if in different ways.
    Attacks should be focused more on WDM and increasing/more, and not flat damage.
    Spells should be focused on flat damage.

Implicit Weapon Balancing:
    Two Handed Weapons hit Area and Single, less defense.
    X and Shield hit Single, more block.
    Unarmed super fast.
    Dual Weild attacks faster and has deflect.
    Pierce type weapons crit more.
    Blunt type weapons stun and direct more.
    Elemental and Occult damage types have less implicit attacks, but pierce through more damage.
        Lightning has higher damage ranges, crits for more, and has a less direct modifier.
    Staves/Occult Tools are useful for their builds due to basic affixes and special mods.
        While they have attacks, attacks are not the central focus of them.

Stats and Growth:
    Each level should exponentially increase calculated stats by 2 to 4%. Then, the game can be about increasing base stats, and everything can be balanced. Not sure how to handle Init, though.
    Base stats would be split into 3 types:
        Character: These are the stats you start with, plus bonii for reaching profiency levels and bestiary levels.
        Items: The items you equipped. This would make balancing them easier too, as you can use the same weapon for all levels. On stat screens, this should include mods too.
    These would be added up and then multiplied by the exponential modifier.
    Of note, the higher the bestiary level of a mob, the less experience it gives.
    ...The experience a monster gives is also increased by levels.

        ☐  When hovering over buff/canvas, it should show buffs info.
    ☐  Triggers
        I need a system whereby when an event buffs, buffs can be applied. For instance, if I have a chance to bleed modifier on an axe, then bleeding should be able to be applied on every attack.

    ☐  Profiency with Gear
    ☐  Profiency with Attacks
    ☐  Limit certain mods to certain tags of Equippables?
        = e.g. "leather" tag on mod only works with armors tagged "leather"



☐  Passage Tags can decide CSS, a la 
    ☐  #passages[data-tags~="Combat"]
    ☐  #passages[data-tags~="Dungeon"]
    ☐  #passages[data-tags~="Overworld"]
    ☐  #passages[data-tags~="Town"]

☐  Tags should be refactored:
    ☐  .tag => Common tags for CSS [classes] e.g. .overworld
    ☐  #tag => Unique tags for CSS [IDs] e.g. #CombatOverlord
    ☐  _tag => Compiler tags e.g. _nostats
