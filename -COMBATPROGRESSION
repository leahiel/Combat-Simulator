TODO for indev release: 
☐  Add Preset character options to start/inbetween.
    ☐  Tank
    ☐  AoE Bruiser
    ☐  Buffer
    ☐  Chaos User
☐  B A L A N C E

When Balancing:
    Monsters` innate stats have to make up for their lack of equipment.
    Mods are what makes humans stronger than monsters, not equipment.
    That means that all equipment should be relatively equal in strength, if in different ways.
    Attacks should be focused more on WDM and increasing/more, and not flat damage.
    Spells should be focused on flat damage.

Implicit Weapon Balancing:
    Two Handed Weapons hit Area and Single, less defense.
    X and Shield hit Single, more block.
    Unarmed super fast.
    Dual Weild attacks faster and has deflect.
    Pierce type weapons crit more.
    Blunt type weapons stun and direct more.
    Elemental and Occult damage types have less implicit attacks, but pierce through more damage.
        Lightning has higher damage ranges, crits for more, and has a less direct modifier.
    Staves/Occult Tools are useful for their builds due to basic affixes and special mods.
        While they have attacks, attacks are not the central focus of them.

Stats and Growth:
    Each level should exponentially increase calculated stats by 2 to 4%. Then, the game can be about increasing base stats, and everything can be balanced. Not sure how to handle Init, though.
    Base stats would be split into 3 types:
        Character: These are the stats you start with, plus bonii for reaching profiency levels and bestiary levels.
        Items: The items you equipped. This would make balancing them easier too, as you can use the same weapon for all levels. On stat screens, this should include mods too.
    These would be added up and then multiplied by the exponential modifier.
    Of note, the higher the bestiary level of a mob, the less experience it gives.
    ...The experience a monster gives is also increased by levels.

        ☐  When hovering over buff/canvas, it should show buffs info.
    ☐  Triggers
        I need a system whereby when an event buffs, buffs can be applied. For instance, if I have a chance to bleed modifier on an axe, then bleeding should be able to be applied on every attack.
        REVIEW: But do I really need one? Can`t I just `if (buff.onAttack)...`?
        ANSWER: No, because buffs are only checked when they`re applied. If they`re not applied, they dont get checked. The trigger system would apply a buff or debuff to either the target or victim.

        ☐  #tag => Unique tags for CSS [IDs] e.g. #CombatOverlord
        ☐  _tag => Compiler tags e.g. _nostats
