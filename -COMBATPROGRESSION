TODO for indev release:

    ☐  Equipment/Mod Screens should show difference in stats.
    ☐  Weapon Screens should show the attacks granted.
    ☐  Temporary Characters should have viewable but not changable equipment
☐  Add content.
    ☐  6 Enemy Families
        ☐  At least 5 enemies each.
    ☑ Attacks

        ☐  8 Accessories
        ☐  8 Armors
    ☐  10 mods for each slot.

☐  Add Preset characters options to start/inbetween.
☐  CSS Update
    ☐  Location and Name embedded into canvases.
    ☑  Targetting functional.

    ☐  When hovering over buff/canvas, it should show buffs info.



Implicit Weapon Balancing:
    Two Handed Weapons hit Area and Single, less defense.
    X and Shield hit Single, more block.
    Unarmed super fast.
    Dual Weild attacks faster and has deflect.
    Pierce type weapons crit more.
    Blunt type weapons stun and direct more.
    Elemental and Occult damage types have less implicit attacks, but pierce through more damage.
        Lightning has higher damage ranges, crits for more, and has a less direct modifier
    Staves/Occult Tools are useful for their builds due to basic affixes and special mods.
        While they have attacks, attacks are not the central focus of them.
