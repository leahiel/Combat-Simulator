Things with the 9 damage types can be split into a single function that takes the `this` obj as an argument.
They can show up iff they have stats that modify them.
Mods can show the stats they mod in green on equipment, to indicate that the stat isn`t the base stat.
When a stat reaches its cap, its numbers can shine gold to represent that.

        Accessory Ideas:
            pretty much the same as the above two?

Implicit Weapon Balancing:
    Two Handed Weapons hit Area and Single, less defense.
    X and Shield hit Single, more block.
    Unarmed super fast.
    Dual Weild attacks faster and has deflect.
    Pierce type weapons crit more.
    Blunt type weapons stun and direct more.
    Elemental and Occult damage types have less implicit attacks, but pierce through more damage.
        Lightning has higher damage ranges, crits for more, and has a less direct modifier
    Staves/Occult Tools are useful for their builds due to basic affixes and special mods.
        While they have attacks, attacks are not the central focus of them.

Stats and Growth:
    Each level should exponentially increase calculated stats by 2 to 4%. Then, the game can be about increasing base stats, and everything can be balanced. Not sure how to handle Init, though.
    Base stats would be split into 3 types:
        Character: These are the stats you start with, plus bonii for reaching profiency levels and bestiary levels.
        Items: The items you equipped. This would make balancing them easier too, as you can use the same weapon for all levels. On stat screens, this should include mods too.
    These would be added up and then multiplied by the exponential modifier.
    Of note, the higher the bestiary level of a mob, the less experience it gives.
    ...The experience a monster gives is also increased by levels.

        I need a system whereby when an event buffs, buffs can be applied. For instance, if I have a chance to bleed modifier on an axe, then bleeding should be able to be applied on every attack.
    ☐  Animations
        ☐  Attack
        ☐  Defense

        ☐  Spell Syncing [Party memebers with the same spell can cast it together, which makes a more powerful spell.]
    ☐  Miracles
    ☐  Energy Shield (or do I want divine shield? Having both would be illogical and/or confusing.)

☐  Passage Tags can decide CSS, a la 
    ☐  #passages[data-tags~="Combat"]
    ☐  #passages[data-tags~="Dungeon"]
    ☐  #passages[data-tags~="Overworld"]
    ☐  #passages[data-tags~="Town"]

☐  Tags should be reused:
    ☐  .tag => Common tags for CSS [classes] e.g. .overworld
    ☐  #tag => Unique tags for CSS [IDs] e.g. #CombatOverlord
    ☐  _tag => Compiler tags e.g. _nostats
