    -= Combat =-
    ☐  Equipment should governed be like this: State.variables.account[[weapon, numowned], [weapon, numowned]]. Max owned should be 2. [Req to enter Alpha]
    ☐  A More/Increased stat for Material/Elemental/Occult. [Req to enter Alpha] [REVIEW: Is this really needed?]
    ☐  More/Increased Health [Req to enter Alpha]
    ☑  Buffs [Req to enter Alpha]
        ☑  On Apply

        ☐  On Attack
        ☐  On Spell
        ☐  On Miracle
        ☐  On Ally Attack
        ☐  When Ally Hit
        ☐  When hovering over buff/canvas, it should show buffs info.
    ☐  Triggers [Req to enter  Alpha]
        I need a system whereby when an event buffs, buffs can be applied. For instance, if I have a chance to bleed modifier on an axe, then bleeding should be able to be applied on every attack.
        REVIEW: But do I really need one? Can`t I just `if (buff.onAttack)...`?
        ANSWER: No, because buffs are only checked when they`re applied. If they`re not applied, they dont get checked. The trigger system would apply a buff or debuff to either the target or victim.

-= Balancing =-
    Monsters` innate stats have to make up for their lack of equipment.
    Mods are what makes humans stronger than monsters, not equipment.
    That means that all equipment should be relatively equal in strength, if in different ways.
    Attacks should be focused more on WDM and increasing/more, and not flat damage.
    Spells should be focused on flat damage.


-= Implicit Weapon Balancing =-
    Two Handed Weapons hit Area and Single, less defense.
    X and Shield hit Single, more block.
    Unarmed/Dual Weild attacks faster and has deflect.
    Pierce type weapons crit more.
    Blunt type weapons stun and direct more.
    Elemental and Occult damage types have less implicit attacks, but pierce through more damage.
        Lightning has higher damage ranges, crits for more, and has a less direct modifier.
    Staves/Occult Tools are useful for their builds due to basic affixes and special mods.
        While they have attacks, attacks are not the central focus of them.
